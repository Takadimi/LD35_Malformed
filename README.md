# NOTICE
Make sure you run the game from inside of the 'bin' folder. The resource paths
are all relative to it!

***

### HOW TO PLAY:
* Left mouse click to shooty shooty.
* Enemies spawn from glowing spawn points.
* Red enemies are harder to kill.
* With every enemy kill your points go up by 100.
* Points also go up by 10 for every second you're alive.
* The aim of the game is to stay alive as long as possible, while racking
* up points by killing the enemies!
